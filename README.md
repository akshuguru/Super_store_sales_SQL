Key SQL Operations
1. Aggregating Sales Over Time
Queries such as GROUP BY on year, product_name, and region calculate total sales, allowing analysis by time period, product, and location.
2. Profitability Analysis
Use of SUM(profit)/SUM(sales)*100 provides an easy way to analyze profit margins for different products.
3. Shipping Time Calculations
Calculations like AVG(DATEDIFF(day, order_date, ship_date)) help derive the average shipping time per state, region, or product category.
4. Top Selling Products
Queries such as ORDER BY total_sales DESC showcase the top-selling products over a certain period.
5. Product Trends and Correlation
Use of statistical functions like AVG(sales) and VAR(sales) to find the average sales and variance across products, uncovering trends.
6. Advanced Filtering and Subqueries
Nested subqueries allow for detailed analysis, such as finding products in specific categories or filtering for regions with the highest sales.
7. Data Transformation with CASE Statements
CASE expressions are used to categorize sales into 'High', 'Medium', and 'Low' sales ranges and differentiate between consumable vs non-consumable products.
8. Union and Set Operations
The UNION and EXCEPT operators help combine and filter different product categories for side-by-side comparisons.
